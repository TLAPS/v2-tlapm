(* Algorithmic Baseball is played on N (usually four) bases which are arranged
   in a circle. Each base is assigned to a team and hosts up to two players.
   Team 1 has only one player and all other teams have two players. In the
   beginning, players are randomly distributed over the bases. Since team 1
   has only one player, exactly one position is open. Each turn, a player
   from an adjacent base may move to the empty spot.
   
   The question now is: independent of the starting arrangement, is there
   a series of moves such that in the end each player ends up on their home
   base.
